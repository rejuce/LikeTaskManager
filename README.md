## What is "LikeTaskManager"?
A Qt based, self-contained (AppImage) process monitor that mimics the feel 
and functionality of Windows10 Task Managers performance tab under Linux.



## Why does the Linux world need another performance monitor? 

There are a myriad of very specialised tools to monitor very specific stats in great detail. But I found none
with the simplicity and compactness of windows task manager, while still providing a good overview of various system
performance indicators while not being forced to stare at a terminal or rudimental terminal graphing. 
For example gnome performance monitor looks nice, but lacks stats about disk I/O or traffic per network interface. Glances 
gives a very comprehensive overview but is hard to look at and kepp and overview.


## How to Install?  

Just download appimage from release tab, give execute permission and thats it. Should work on all Linux flavours newer than 
Ubut 16.04. No messing with dpendencies, not install, just run.
It can always be updated by clicking in the topbar "Update App" pulling the latest version via deltaupdate using appimageupdate from Github.
